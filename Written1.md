1. Is it possible for an automated system to "understand natural language"? Explain your answer in your own words. (10 points)

ANSWER: No, it's impossible. As mentioned in the lecture 2, it's an AI complete problem. 

2. Read Turing's paper, "Computing Machinery and Intelligence," (https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/LIX/236/433/986238) and write a summary (~350 words) of his arguments for the possibility and existence of artificial intelligence. Don't just restate what he said, explain in your own words. (20 points)

ANSWER: 

3. Research Searle's Chinese Room argument. Write a short summary of the argument in your own words and discuss potential objections to the argument in the literature (~350 words). Cite all references appropriately. (20 points)

ANSWER:

4. Research one AI system that can generate natural language, such as ELIZA, SHRDLU, WATSON, etc and write a summary (~350-700 words) describing how the system works and its strengths and weaknesses. Cite all references appropriately. (20 points)

ANSWER:

5. Research one non-English language. Write a summary of the major differences in this language from English (~350-700 words). Differences can be syntactic or semantic, but must be nontrivial. If your group does not have any familiarity with any non-English language, find someone who does (outside of class) and write an answer with their help. Wikipedia/Duolingo or similar can also be useful. (20 points)

ANSWER:

6. Using your answer to question 5, and thinking about the NLP/NLG pipelines and various tasks we have discussed in class, describe what differences might arise in building NLP systems for the language you researched, as compared to building an NLP/NLG system for English (~350-700 words).
